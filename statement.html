      <p> Kasia Pluto (b. 1995) is an American artist and art researcher based in Berks County, Pennsylvania, primarily working in drawing and painting.</p>

<p>She finds artistic influence in video games, cartoons, computer graphics, internet culture, and her daily experience. Themes explored are violence, identity, addiction, obsession, loneliness, and alienation.</p>

<p>Pluto's work is greatly influenced by the experience of growing up on the computer and sharing her artwork on the internet. To this day, she collaborates with anonymous artists in virtual communities,</p>
      <p>which has been a lifelong motivator for her to continue her work. Posting her artwork in online forums and spaces for feedback has been a foundational way for her to deepen her understanding of art as a communal, </p>
      <p>interpersonal practice. Websites such as tumblr, 4chan, and Discord are virtual spaces she frequents primarily for research purposes.</p>

<p>Pluto is interested in the way that the Old Masters worked. Methods such as, hand-mulling paint, priming linen using rabbit skin glue and Oil ground, and using traditional pigments are ways that she feels deepen </p>
      <p>her connection to the Old Masters. Adding in techniques, traditional colors, and symbols used by the artists before us in her artwork- are ways that she keeps old traditions alive in the modern era. </p>
     <p>Conducting painting research meticulously for each tool and technique she finds, the resulting artworks as well as the painting research she documents are some of her favorite aspects of making work.</p>
